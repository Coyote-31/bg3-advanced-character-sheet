# AToR : All Types of Resistance (BG3 mod)

This is a mod for the game Baldur's Gate 3.

The purpose of this mod is to display **All Types of Resistance** including ones without any immunity, resistance or weakness.

Also improve Character and Party panel for Spell Book UI in general (Class info / Spell list / Reactions)

## 🔖 Version
- 📦 **AToR** mod : `1.3.0`
- 🎮 **BG3** compatible : `4.1.1`

## ✨ Features

- Display **all** types of resistance including ones without any immunity, resistance or weakness.
- Resistances are divided into **3 rows** and **rearranged**.
- **Reverse order** between Resistances and Conditions.
- Some icons are reworked for a **better visual**.
- **Tooltip added** for damage type without any immunity, resistance or weakness.

### 🎁 Bonus :

**BIG** rework of the whole **Spell Book UI** ( Class info / Spells / Reactions ) in Character and Party Panels, it's actually much more than just *All Types of Resistance* now ! 😅
- The user interface is now *responsive* to be compatible with all variations of **BCPP** mods.
- Extend the **size** of useful content in Party Panel.
- **Align** everything in its right place.
- Replace some backgrounds and sprites to **fix artifacts** in vanilla images ( Party Panel Bg, Tabs, ... ).

## 🔀 Compatibility

### 🟢 **Compatible** with the following mods :
- **Better Character and Party Panels** ( *BCPP* ) *All variants* : Tested with BCPP v1.5.9
- **Better Target Info** ( *BTI* ) : Tested with BTI v1.1.6

    > The icons of resistance work fine. Unfortunately, I can't achieved to display the none ones. But 13 icons on top of the screen all the time is what you really want to anyway ?

### 🟡 Compatible with **minor bugs** :
- **Better Tooltips** ( *BT* ) : Tested with BT v1.0.8

  - **Minor Bug** : Tooltips for no resistance/immunity/vulnerable are displayed as *vulnerable* 
  ( **Believe in the icon** and not the tooltip )
  
  - **Install** : You **have to** rename `BetterTooltips.pak` file from *BT* mod into `_BetterTooltips.pak`
    
    > Any character before 'A' works, as does '_' if you follow the instruction to install.
    >
    > Because *BT* needs to overwrite my mod's files and it doesn't work conventionally (Like with BG3MM). *AToR* and *BT* are UI mods they handle the order differently (Thats why they are in *overrides* in BG3MM).

### 🔴 **Not compatible** with the following mods :
- None -> *Tell me if you find one ❗*

### 📄 Modified Files :
