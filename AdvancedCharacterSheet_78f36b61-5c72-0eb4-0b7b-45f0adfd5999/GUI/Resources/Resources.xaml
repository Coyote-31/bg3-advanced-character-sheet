		This file will be loaded first when you mod activates.
		In here you can define all your assets and resources like Colors, Brushes, Fonts, ...
		To be referenced in your Library files.
		
		By adding a 'MergedDictionary' in here, you can organise your Resources in multiple files.
		
		You'll be able to use or override the resource keys defined in previously loaded mods and
		those defined by Larian Studios.
